## Local Branches

---

### Branches are cheap!

- Branch entry is just reference to point in time
- Edits on branch recorded as changes from branch point
- Many branches, single working copy.

---

### Be Prepared!

- Never know how long a change will take
- Working on multiple changes/fixes at the same time
- Emergency work
- Can be created after the fact, but now you have 2 problems

---

### Keeping Up to Date

- Pull often (rebase or merge, discussed later)
- Easier to deal with lots of small changes/conflicts, if any, daily

---

### Examples

In the beginning:
```shell
$ git checkout master
$ git checkout -b fix-divide-by-zero origin/master  # descriptive branch name!
```

While working:
```shell
$ git pull
```

In the end:
```shell
$ git rebase -i
$ git checkout master
$ git merge -no-ff fix-divide-by-zero
$ git branch -d fix-divide-by-zero
```
